# Credentials and updates

OpenWiki has two operational concerns that matter for both users and maintainers:

1. local credential storage in `~/.openwiki/.env`, and
2. persisted update metadata in `openwiki/.last-update.json`.

It also ships with GitHub Actions and GitLab CI workflow examples for scheduled updates.

## Local credential storage

`src/env.ts` manages a private environment file under the user's home directory:

- directory: `~/.openwiki` (mode `0o700`)
- file: `~/.openwiki/.env` (mode `0o600`)

The file stores provider configuration and API keys:

- `OPENWIKI_PROVIDER` — the selected model provider
- `OPENWIKI_MODEL_ID` — the default model ID
- Provider API keys: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `BASETEN_API_KEY`, `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` (the `copilot-cli` provider has no API key)
- Base URLs: `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` (optional — routes the anthropic provider at an Anthropic-compatible endpoint other than the default API) and `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL` (required by the openai-compatible provider, which has no default endpoint)
- `OPENWIKI_COPILOT_CLI_COMMAND` — optional override for the `copilot` binary name/path used by the `copilot-cli` provider (defaults to `copilot`)
- Optional LangSmith settings: `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`, `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT`, `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2`

The loader merges those values into `process.env`, while preferring existing process-level values over file values. Deprecated keys (`OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_ORG_ID`, `OPENAI_PROJECT`) are skipped on load and removed on save.

`src/credentials.tsx` provides the interactive bootstrap flow when required:

- prompts for a provider (arrow-key selection menu),
- prompts for the provider's API key (skipped for the `copilot-cli` provider, which shows an install/authentication info screen instead),
- prompts for a model choice (arrow-key selection from the provider's model list, or a custom model ID; also skipped for `copilot-cli`, which uses a fixed pseudo-model ID),
- optionally prompts for a LangSmith key,
- writes the results with restrictive file permissions,
- removes deprecated OpenAI-related environment variables when saving.

The setup flow runs for **all** interactive commands (chat, init, and update) when credentials are missing — not just chat. In non-interactive mode (no TTY or `--print`), missing provider keys produce an error instead of a prompt (not applicable to `copilot-cli`, which has no key to be missing).

## Provider resolution

`resolveConfiguredProvider()` in `src/constants.ts` determines the active provider:

1. If `OPENWIKI_PROVIDER` is set and valid, use it.
2. Otherwise, if `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is present, default to `openrouter`.
3. Otherwise, fall back to `DEFAULT_PROVIDER` (`openrouter`).

`needsCredentialSetup()` in `src/credentials.tsx` checks whether the provider env var, the provider's API key, a model ID (unless overridden), and a LangSmith key are all present. Any missing value triggers the interactive flow. For CLI-based providers (`isCliProvider()`, currently `copilot-cli`), the API key and model ID checks are skipped since neither applies.

## Model and credential diagnostics

The env layer also produces diagnostics for the CLI UI. Those diagnostics report:

- where each credential came from (`process.env`, `~/.openwiki/.env`, both, or `unset`),
- whether the value is unset,
- the apparent length,
- a masked preview,
- warnings for suspicious formatting such as whitespace, newlines, quotes, or bracketed suffixes,
- invalid model IDs,
- invalid provider values.

Diagnostics cover all six provider keys plus `OPENWIKI_PROVIDER`, `OPENWIKI_MODEL_ID`, the base URLs (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL`), `OPENWIKI_COPILOT_CLI_COMMAND`, and `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`. This makes startup problems easier to diagnose without exposing secret values (non-secret values such as the provider, model ID, base URLs, and the Copilot CLI command are shown in full).

## Update metadata

After successful `init` or `update` runs where the `openwiki/` content changed, `src/agent/utils.ts` writes `openwiki/.last-update.json` with:

- `updatedAt`
- `command`
- `gitHead`
- `model`

The content-change check uses `createOpenWikiContentSnapshot()`, which hashes the `openwiki/` directory (excluding `.last-update.json`). If the hash is identical before and after the run, metadata is not written. This prevents scheduled update loops from updating the timestamp when no documentation changed.

Update runs use this metadata to build a change summary since the previous successful OpenWiki execution — preferring `gitHead` for a precise commit range, falling back to `updatedAt` for a time-based range.

## Scheduled CI workflows

The repository includes `examples/openwiki-update.yml` as a copyable GitHub Actions scheduled update workflow. It:

- runs on schedule (daily at 08:00 UTC) and on manual dispatch,
- checks out the repository,
- installs Node.js 22,
- installs OpenWiki globally,
- runs `openwiki --update --print`,
- passes `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENWIKI_MODEL_ID`, and `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` from GitHub secrets,
- opens a pull request with `peter-evans/create-pull-request` scoped to the `openwiki` directory.

The workflow is a good reference for automated maintenance. The repo also contains a `checks.yml` workflow for CI (lint/format checks).

The repository also includes `examples/openwiki-update.gitlab-ci.yml` as a copyable GitLab CI scheduled update job. It:

- runs from a scheduled pipeline or a manually triggered web pipeline,
- installs OpenWiki globally in a Node.js 22 container,
- runs `openwiki --update --print`,
- skips the rest of the job when `openwiki/` did not change,
- commits changes to a generated `openwiki/update-$CI_PIPELINE_ID` branch,
- pushes that branch back to the GitLab project, and
- creates a merge request targeting the project's default branch through the GitLab API.

GitLab users should configure protected CI/CD variables for the model provider key, for example `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, and `OPENWIKI_GITLAB_TOKEN`. The GitLab token needs permission to push a branch and create merge requests in the target project.

## Things to watch when changing operations

- The `.env` file lives outside the repository, so changes to its format should be conservative.
- Never document real secret values; only document the presence and purpose of the configuration.
- If update metadata semantics change, update both the agent runtime and the docs that explain how update runs are scoped.
- Scheduled automation depends on the same CLI entrypoint as local users, so workflow changes should be validated against `package.json` and the CLI help text.
- When adding a provider, update `managedEnvKeys` in `src/env.ts` so the env file is formatted correctly and diagnostics cover the new key.
- The content-snapshot check means CI runs that produce no changes will not update `.last-update.json` or open a PR with metadata-only changes.
